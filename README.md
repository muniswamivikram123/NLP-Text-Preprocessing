# NLP-Text-Preprocessing

## How did I learn text preprocessing?
I learned text preprocessing from the article 'SPACY for Beginners - NLP' on the Medium platform, created by Pema Grg. It was easy to understand, and I referred to it to improve my skills.

After learning it, I worked on a project titled 'Extracting Information from Documents,' referring to YouTube. The channel name is 'NLP and CSS 201: Beyond the Basics.'
